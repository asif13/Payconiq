List Transaction Screen consists of 
1) Transactions details like description amount 
2) It displays a snapshot of coordinates of the given coordinate using MKSnaphot. Since all the coordinate 
    points to somehwere in Indian Ocean, It just shows a snapshot of sea. With better corrdinate the UI would look much better and provide relevant information in best way possible.
